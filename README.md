# Interactive-Learning-App

This is a web based learning application. A user registers and begin learning different courses. The courses are added dynamically. 

I intend to improve the app with time. The app will provide video contents with infographics as well as code examples.

The app will also provide challenges for practice as well as project examples where a learner can have a real life coding experience.


# NOTE:

This application is carrently in its very innitial stages and therefore not much data has been added to the database. This will change as time goes as the development is in progress.
